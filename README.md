# even-odd-function
Write a C++ program that checks all numbers from 0 to 1000 and determines whether each number is even or odd. You must create a function bool isEven(int number) that takes an integer as input and returns true if the number is even and false if the number is odd. Use this function in your main program to print whether each number in the range is even or odd.
